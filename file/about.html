    	<h1>What We Do:</h1>

		<p>The SchoolGirl Project hosts informative events on-campus, 
		with the goal of promoting learning and discussion about issues 
		surrounding womenâ€™s education and international development. 
		These events are open to everyone, no previous knowledge required! 
		These are not simple problems and we all can learn a great deal from 
		the opinions and experiences of others. 

		The SchoolGirl Project also fundraises for partner organizations doing 
		relevant work abroad. Currently, we are partnering with the Afghan 
		Institute of Learning, a Afghan non-profit which supports the education 
		of those affected by war, particularly women and girls. Learn more about 
		AIL <a href="http://www.afghaninstituteoflearning.org" style="text-decoration:none">HERE.</a></p>

		<h1>How We Work:</h1>

		<p>The SchoolGirl Project is a team of students passionate about change, with 
		a project-like dynamic. Our meeting include round table discussions, 
		brainstorming sessions and active participation. The SchoolGirl Project is 
		also ideal for those eager to build their leadership skills, and we support 
		members who wish to develop their own project on and off-campus.</p>
